    <h1>What Is Cloud Computing?</h1>

    <p>Cloud computing is a great innovation in information technology, that has resulted in important advancements for
      services on the internet (Alam, 2020). It is a model that allows for accessing computing resources in
      information technology (Benlian et al., 2018). To put it simply, cloud computing is storing and accessing data as
      well as programs over the internet instead of it them being stored locally on a computer’s hard drive (Rashid and
      Chaturvedi, 2019).  This allows users to do many things such as: access programs, applications and files from any
      device that is connected to the network/internet.</p>

    <h2>Main Characteristics Of Cloud Computing</h2>

    <p>Cloud computing has many characteristics, but there are predominantly 5 main features of cloud computing
      (Dillon et al., 2010):</p>
    <div class="bullet-points">
      <ul>
        <li>On-demand self-service</li>
        <li>Broad Network Access</li>
        <li>Resource Pooling</li>
        <li>Rapid Elasticity</li>
        <li>Measure Service</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
    <h3>On-demand self-service</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The first characteristic is on-demand self-service. A consumer with an immediate need at a specific timeslot can
      benefit from computing resources automatically without the need for human interaction (Dillon et al., 2010).
      This includes cloud services such as storage, network access, applications and server times (Rashid and Chaturvedi
      , 2019). This simply means that users can access cloud resources without the need for human interaction from a
      service provider.
    </p>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Broad Network Access</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Broad network access is when computing resources are delivered over a network – like the internet – and used by
      numerous client applications on a user’s site (Dillon et al., 2010). In short, users can access cloud resources
      over a network at any time from anywhere, as long as they are connected to the network. They can also access them
      from any device connected to the network. For example, desktop PC’s, laptops, smartphones and tablets
      (Rashid and Chaturvedi, 2019).
    </p>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Resource Pooling</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Resource pooling is the term used when talking about the resources that are pooled into the cloud. A service
      provider’s resources are pooled intending to serve multiple consumers (Dillon et al., 2010). Then different
      physical and virtual resources are reallocated according to consumer demand (Mell and Grance, 2009). Furthermore,
      these resources do not depend on location, to an extent that consumers don’t have control or the knowledge over
      their location (Rashid and Chaturvedi, 2019). This means that consumers are unable to tell where data is being
      stored in the cloud.
    </p>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Rapid Elasticity</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Computing resources can be immediate for the consumer rather than persistent (Dillon et al., 2010). This means
      that “computing resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned and released based on the demand of the
      consumer” (Rashid and Chaturvedi, 2019). Furthermore, consumers may view these resources to be infinite, as they
      can be consumed rapidly to meet peek requirement at any time (Dillon et al., 2010). To put it simply, rapid
      elasticity aims to allow the consumer to change the number of resources they need from the pool.
    </p>
    <div class="section">
      <h3>Measure Service</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The final characteristic is measure service. Measure service is the term used when talking about the computing
      resources and services used by a consumer and how they are measured by a service provider. While resources are
      pooled and shared by a variety of consumers, the infrastructure of the cloud is able to measure the usage of
      resources for each consumer (Dillon et al., 2010). This is usually done through a pay-per-use model by the service
      provider, similar to the usage of gas and electricity (Rashid and Chaturvedi, 2019).
