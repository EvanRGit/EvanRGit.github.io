    <p>While cloud computing is a great innovation and has helped with many aspects of information technology, it still
    isn't perfect. This section will look at both of the positive and negative aspects of cloud computing.</p>

                <strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Cloud computing can be cost-effective for users and consumers.
                For example, businesses can remove costly systems such as on site servers for storage which would also
                require maintenance (Abdalla and Varol, 2019). Then they can instead use cloud storage from a service
                provider which would be more cost-effective in the long term.

                <strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Cloud storage can offer users almost unlimited storage
                (Apostu et al., 2014). From a business perspective this is useful as mentioned before, they would not
                have to set up physical storage on their own. Furthermore, maintenance of storage like backups and
                purchasing additional storage are the service provider's responsibility (Abdalla and Varol, 2019).

                <strong>Automatic Software Implementation:</strong> The cloud allows for software to be integrated
                automatically. As a result of this, user's do not need to change applications based on their preference
                as this is mostly done by the cloud (Apostu et al., 2014).

                <strong>Simplicity:</strong> From the client's perspective cloud computing is quite simple to use and
                user-friendly. This is due to that mostly on the client's side, they only need to use a web browser to
                interact with cloud services (Abdalla and Varol, 2019). Furthermore, applications and programs that take
                on the cloud-based form are usually less demanding to set up and maintain (Abdalla and Varol, 2019).

                <strong>Reliability:</strong> Security is a big issue in cloud computing. When using cloud services, all
                data and any sensitive information used will be sent to the service provider (Apostu et al., 2014). This
                means user's/client's need to make sure they are choosing a reliable service provider, as their
                information could be at risk if it is not kept safe and secure (Apostu et al., 2014).

            <div class="section">
              <li>
                <strong>Attackers:</strong> Even if a service provider is reliable, while data and information is stored
                on the cloud it will always be prone to hackers. Hackers may attack service providers, access and leak
                sensitive data (Abdalla and Varol, 2019). This is due to the increased vulnerability of storing data on
                the cloud (Apostu et al., 2014).

              <li>
                <strong>Downtime:</strong> Client's depend on the service provider to constantly be up. Therefore, when
                there is downtime it can result in user's not being able to access their services. This could go on for
                extended periods of time and is likely out of the client's control, as downtime could be due to system
                errors on the service providers end (Abdalla and Varol, 2019). Furthermore, client's depend on the
                reliability of their internet connection (Apostu et al., 2014).
